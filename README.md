Conversion of JPG files to PDF, Word, and PowerPoint formats.
Error handling for file not found and invalid choice inputs.
Installation instructions for required libraries.

Repository Contents:

converter.py: The main Python script containing the conversion functions and the program logic.
README.md: A Markdown file with instructions on how to use the program and any additional information.
requirements.txt: A text file listing the required Python libraries and their versions.

Instructions for Use:

Install the required libraries mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
Run the converter.py script using a Python interpreter.
Enter the path to the JPG file when prompted.
Select the desired output format by entering the corresponding number (1 for PDF, 2 for Word, 3 for PowerPoint).
The converted file will be saved in the same directory as the input file.
Note: Make sure to have the required libraries installed before running the program.
